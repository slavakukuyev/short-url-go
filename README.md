URL Shortener App in Go

URL Shortener App in Go
=======================

A simple URL shortener app written in Go. This app allows users to input long URLs, and it generates short aliases for them. The short URLs are then used to redirect users to the original long URLs. The app uses a URLShortener struct with a caching mechanism to efficiently manage the mappings between short and long URLs. It also provides an API for shortening URLs and retrieving the original URLs from the cache. This project serves as a basic example of how to implement a URL shortener service in Go.
